"""Run the functional suite and print a PASS/FAIL summary.

These tests target the **Unity** build (the Obj-C build is no longer functionally
tested). They ask "does the Unity build WORK?" — a different question from
tests/compare_unity*.py, which asks whether it LOOKS like the Obj-C baseline.

Every game test launches the app and walks itself to the main menu, so one
failure cannot cascade into the next — the run always reports on all of them.
The first test is the TestFlight install pre-step. Exit code is non-zero if
any test failed, for CI.

Prereqs: WDA up via scripts/wda.sh while the phone is online, iPhone unlocked,
`DEVICE_UDID` exported, TestFlight installed and signed in, and the Spider
invite accepted. The first test installs the build and the first-launch test
then puts the phone in Airplane Mode for the offline suite.

Run:  ./.venv/bin/python -u tests/run_all.py
      ./.venv/bin/python -u tests/run_all.py verifyPlay verifyGamePlay   # a subset
      SKIP_VISUAL=1 ./.venv/bin/python -u tests/run_all.py               # skip baselines

Stdout is line-buffered so each case START/PASS/FAIL and every tap/shot/scroll
prints as it happens, even when the runner is not attached to a TTY.

# NOTE THE SUITE IS NOW DESTRUCTIVE: it ends by wiping local statistics. That is
# deliberate — see the resetStats entry at the bottom of TESTS.
#
# Not in the suite, on purpose:
#   verifyAds       — needs the device ONLINE by definition (it is the ad axis).
#   visitLastScore  — its Game Center legs need the device ONLINE and a
#                     signed-in Apple account. Its first half (the picker's
#                     "Last Score", the header, the period stepper) would run
#                     offline fine, but a case that is half-checked in the
#                     offline suite is worse than one run deliberately online.
#   verifyChooseLook— REPAINTS the table and LEAVES it repainted: the chosen
#                     surface and card back are saved by the app. Sitting in the
#                     middle of a suite that reads the table, it makes every
#                     later failure ask "did that break, or did the felt move
#                     under it?" — 'menu' is white text ON the felt and scores
#                     0.74-0.84 across surfaces against a 0.72 bar. Run it alone,
#                     or last, once everything else has already run.
#   verifyAdFreeVersion — the hand-off works offline, but the whole point of the
#                     test is the App Store page it lands on, and offline that is
#                     the same "No Internet Connection" screen for every link. A
#                     screenshot of that proves nothing, so run it online.
#   submitFeedback  — opens a real MAIL DRAFT, so it needs a Mail account
#                     configured on the device. Without one iOS shows "No Mail
#                     Accounts" instead of a composer and the suite would fail
#                     for an environment reason, not a build one. (It never
#                     sends, and deletes the draft from a finally.)

# Tests that are currently EXPECTED to fail because the Unity port dropped the
# feature. They still run and still report FAIL — a known regression should stay
# visible — but the summary names them so a red run is not mistaken for a broken
# rig. Delete an entry once the port restores the feature.
#
# openDebugTools was listed here and is NOT any more: the QA entry point is
# present on Unity after all. The earlier "it opens nothing" reading came from
# aiming the tap burst at the About wordmark; the gesture lives on the spider
# emblem above it, and 5 rapid taps there reveal the Dev Panel button.
#
# verifyMoreGamesIcons is NOT a port gap at all, and is no longer expected to
# fail. The promo strip only appears once AT LEAST ONE GAME HAS BEEN COMPLETED —
# on a fresh install with stats at 0 the app does not draw it. That is why the
# test sits LAST in TESTS, after verifyVictory, which wins a game with the Dev
# Panel cheat and so satisfies the precondition. Keep that order.
#
# (An earlier note here called the empty strip a build-353 regression. That was
# wrong — it was written from a fresh-install capture with zero wins.)
