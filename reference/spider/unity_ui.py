"""Unity-build UI driver — the foundation of the Unity functional suite.

This is the Unity counterpart to flows.py (which drives the Obj-C build). It is
deliberately a SEPARATE module rather than a branch inside flows.py, because
almost nothing about locating a control is shared between the two renderers.

Why the Unity build needs its own driver
----------------------------------------
Unity draws the entire UI into one opaque view. There is no accessibility tree,
so Poco sees nothing and WDA reports a single anonymous element — element-based
automation is simply unavailable. That leaves pixels.

The pixel-fidelity tools (tests/compare_unity*.py) therefore drive Unity by fixed
coordinates, and for *them* that is the right call: a comparison must not locate
its targets using the very pixels it is measuring, or a real regression could
move a button and the harness would silently follow it.

Functional testing wants the opposite trade. Here we ask "does the button work?",
so finding the button by sight is not cheating — it is the assertion. Templates
cropped from Unity's OWN rendering (scripts/crop_unity_assets.py,
scripts/derive_unity_assets.py -> UNITY_ASSETS) let a test say "the Options
control is on screen" and tap wherever it actually is. That survives the layout
shifts between Unity builds that broke the hardcoded coordinates in
compare_unity.py, and it turns "did we land on the right screen?" into a real
check instead of an assumption.

Note the inherited assets/ templates are Obj-C crops and do NOT match Unity —
this module never uses them.

Conventions
-----------
  * Coordinates are in capture-pixel space (whatever snapshot() returns).
  * Locators are template names in config.UNITY_ASSETS.
  * seen() waits; find()/is_on() are single-shot.
  * find() is scale-aware, so ONE template set serves every 19.5:9 device.
  * Every helper that can fail returns a bool/None; tests turn those into
    failures with expect(), so messages stay in the test.

# ── device-independent template matching ──────────────────────────
# ONE template set serves every phone in the 19.5:9 family. The crops in
# UNITY_ASSETS were cut from captures REF_WIDTH px wide; before matching, each is
# resized by (this device's capture width / REF_WIDTH).
#
# That works because Unity scales its whole UI by width across these devices —
# measured, not assumed. Cross-matching every template between an iPhone 11 (828)
# and an iPhone 14 Pro Max (1290) capture of the SAME screen: 49/49 match, median
# score 0.978, and the winning scale clusters at 0.645 (sd 0.003) against a
# predicted width ratio of 0.642. The ~0.5% gap between predicted and actual is
# exactly why a narrow sweep is kept around the prediction instead of trusting
# the ratio outright.
#
# Covered by one set: iPhone 11 (828x1792), iPhone 14 Pro Max (1290x2796),
# iPhone 16 Pro (1206x2622) — all ~19.5:9, so the scale is a pure width ratio.
# NOT covered: the iPhone 7 (750x1334, 16:9), whose UI genuinely reflows rather
# than scaling; it keeps its own per-device set.

# font, translucent rounded card, system button pills. Those are laid out in
# POINTS, so between an @2x phone and an @3x phone they scale by the point
# density (3/2 = 1.500), while Unity's own artwork scales by the width ratio
# (1206/828 = 1.4565 on the iPhone 16 Pro). Only ~3% apart — and that 3% is
# enough to miss: on the iPhone 16 Pro `prompt_abandon` peaked at 0.962 @1.500
# but only 0.694 within the width-based sweep, so the abandon prompt went
# unrecognised and was answered "No", which cancelled every deal in the suite.
#
# Hence a per-template basis rather than one wider sweep, which would just
# reintroduce the false positives the tight sweep exists to prevent.
REF_POINT_SCALE = float(os.environ.get("UNITY_REF_POINT_SCALE", "2.0"))

# peaks at exactly the point-density ratio, not the width ratio.
# Game Center is the third regime and belongs here too: the sheet Spider

    every one of these pages is the same publisher's same layout.

    Three things measured on this build, each of which breaks a naive read:

      * The title comes back as ONE element even though it WRAPS to two lines on
        screen, so there is nothing to stitch together.
      * The store injects a '▻' glyph INTO the title, at a position that
        varies with the name — '▻ Solitaire: Classic Cards' but
        'Card ▻ Games'. Exact-matching the raw string would therefore fail
        for a reason that has nothing to do with the destination, so the glyph is
        stripped and the whitespace re-normalised here, once, for every caller.
      * The page takes a moment to render, and reading during it returns the
        previous screen's text. So this waits for two consecutive identical
        reads rather than trusting the first non-empty one.

    1. Terms & Conditions / Privacy Policy, by IMAGE (tc_continue). NOT by alert
       text: despite what this docstring used to claim, WDA CANNOT SEE this
       pop-up. Measured on build 363 with a live session while it was plainly on
       screen, /alert/text returned "" and /alert/buttons []. It is drawn by the
       app, not presented as a UIAlertController, so the text branch below never
       matched and the gate was never dismissed — dead code that went unnoticed
       because nothing in the suite cold-launched until verifyFirstLaunch was
       added to it. flows.py (the Obj-C driver) had this right all along.
    2. The App Tracking Transparency prompt, also by IMAGE — that one is
       presented out of process, so /alert/* 404s on it (helpers has the
       measurement). It is answered "Allow": the app wants tracking granted
       before it will let the first launch through.
    3. A first-launch gate that IS a real alert, by its TEXT
       (FIRST_LAUNCH_GATES). Nothing on this build takes this path; it is kept
       as a cheap fallback in case a later build presents one properly.

    Interstitial ads are NOT hunted here. `ad_close` false-matched the first-
    launch / menu chrome at (111, 1730) — far from the real X at ~(50, 136) —
    and that tap opened the App Store. Ads are closed by `dismiss_ad()` /
    `recover()` from callers that have already lost Spider's own UI.

    Only alerts positively recognised as gates are accepted. The game's own
    confirmations are WDA-visible alerts too, and the right answer depends on
    which one it is (abandon wants Yes, the rules offer wants No), so anything
    unrecognised is left for settle_prompts() / answer_dialog() to judge.

    Both gates are nominally once per install, but they come back far more often
    than that: the app writes its state when it goes to the BACKGROUND, and a
    cold launch terminates it from the FOREGROUND, so the "agreed" flag can be
    lost and the pair reappears on the next launch. Every TestFlight build is
    also a fresh install.

# Spider draws several of its confirmations itself instead of presenting a
# UIAlertController: the "Did you know?" tip on the game table, "Would you
# like to reset local scores?" on Statistics, and the first-time Game Center
# notice on Last Score. All are the same widget — a pale, translucent
# rounded card carrying one or two pill buttons along its bottom —
# and WDA sees nothing of them, so they have to be read out of the picture.
#
# They cannot be TEMPLATE-matched, and the crops that used to try (`prompt_tip`,
# `tip_ok`) are gone. Those were cut from a rendering where the card was DARK
# GREEN with WHITE text; this build draws it pale mint with BLACK text, so the
# two are near photographic negatives. Measured on build 363 against captures
# where the tip was plainly on screen, `prompt_tip` scored 0.344 and 0.397
# against a 0.70 bar: it never matched, is_on("prompt_tip") was always False,
# and settle_prompts() therefore never saw the tip at all. The card then
# swallowed every tap aimed at the table underneath — which is how two of the
# four levels in verifyDifficultyLevels failed as "the cheat did not lead to the
# victory screen", a long way from the real cause.
#
# They were deleted rather than re-cut, for two reasons that would outlive a
# re-cut: the card is translucent, so any crop bakes in whatever sat behind it
# when it was taken (the same trap already documented for prompt_abandon), and
# the tip comes in a one-button and a two-button variant whose button geometry
# differs.
#
# What IS stable is the shape: a large, solid, uniformly bright rounded rect,
# much brighter than the screen behind it, with darker pills inset along its
# bottom. Both are measured against the picture's OWN colours rather than fixed
# values, so a repainted surface — verifyChooseLook applies one, and runs before
# verifyDifficultyLevels — moves card and pills together and changes nothing.
#

#   card bg BGR (230,242,172)   pill BGR (199,211,141)   felt BGR (109,131,2)

    Why this exists, and why it hands back the FRAME as well. The Options page
    keeps gliding for over two seconds after a swipe — measured on build 363,
    the visible band was still changing 2.1 s after the scroll ended. Every read
    here used to cost a PAIR of captures: opt_row() located the label in frame
    A, and opt_knob() then hunted the knob in frame B. When the page moved
    between the two, the y taken from A no longer pointed at the row in B — and
    opt_knob only searches +/- OPT_ROW_BAND, about 39 px on this screen, either
    side of it.

    Measured drift between two consecutive reads was 35 px, which lands right on
    that edge — and that is the nasty case. Rather than miss the knob and return
    None, opt_knob catches PART of it, reports a narrower knob, and _value_from
    turns the narrower knob into a plausible-looking but WRONG number.

    That is what failed the Card Lowering check in verifyOptions: it read 0.57
    against a 0.50 +/- 0.05 target, which looked exactly like a stepped slider
    that could not reach mid-track. It is not stepped. With the page settled the
    same knob reads (634.5, 74) and 0.4971 on every attempt, same-frame and
    fresh-frame alike.

    Handing back the frame closes the hole for good: the caller reads the knob
    out of the very frame the row was found in, so however far the page glides
    afterwards, the two measurements still agree with each other. It costs no
    extra captures in the normal case — two frames is exactly what the old
